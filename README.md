# Mapping Earthquakes

The purpose of this project was to learn visualization techniques for mapping data.  We used data about recent earthquakes and created maps of the results.  API requests were made to host geographical data through Mapbox and given layers using Leaflet control plugins. The maps were populated with GeoJSON data using JavaScript and the Data-Driven Documents (D3) library.
